## Assignments

### [A0: Benchmarking a Parallel System](A0/README.md)

Assignment 0 focuses on benchmarking a parallel system. It explores techniques for evaluating and measuring the performance of parallel computing systems.

### [A1: 2D Filter in OMP](A1/README.md)

Assignment 1 involves implementing a 2D filter using OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) for parallel execution. OpenMP is a widely used API for parallel programming.

### [A2: Sorting Small Integers with MPI](A2/README.md)

Assignment 2 delves into the implementation of sorting algorithms for small integers using MPI (Message Passing Interface), a standard for parallel programming in distributed memory systems.

### [A3: Gaussian Kernel in NVIDIA CUDA](A3/README.md)

Assignment 3 entails the implementation of a Gaussian Kernel using NVIDIA CUDA, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model. CUDA is specifically designed for NVIDIA GPUs.
